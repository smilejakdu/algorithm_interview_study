'''
높이를 입력받아 비 온후 얼마나 많은 물이 쌓일 수 있는지 계산하라.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
'''

height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    print(height)
    return

print(trap(height))
